# Predicting-Level-of-Violence-and-Participation-During-Social-Unrest
These files are part of a graduate research project that focuses on developing a model that can predict the level of violence and participation during a social event, such as a protest, rally, or demonstration based on Twitter language. The data consists of tweets collected around specific demonstrations throughout the USA, Australia, and the UK. Additional data on the specifics of the events were collected from official news outlets. I utilized Embedded Language Modeling (ELMo) to create a methodology to define the level of violence and participation. In this method, the word representations are functions of the entire input sentence and are computed on top of a deep bidirectional language model (biLM). ELMo considers not only word vectors but also syntax, semantics, and model polysemy.

Included is an example of my json files.
